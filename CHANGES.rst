  * Added interpolation support to GeoHeatmap series type.
  * Added ``AxisEvents.point_break_out`` property.
  * Added ``.node_alignment`` property to ``SankeyOptions`` and ``SankeySeries``.
  * Added ``.link_color_mode`` property to ``SankeyOptions`` and ``SankeySeries``.
  * Added ``.inactive_other_points`` property to multiple series types.
  * Added ``.grouping`` property to Lollipop series type.
  * Added ``.low_marker`` property Area Range and Dumbell series types.

-----------------------

Release 1.4.1
=========================================

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed incorrect cross-dependency inheritance in 
  ``options/series_generator.create_series_obj()`` (#36)

---------------------


Release 1.4.0
=========================================

* **MAJOR** performance gains in the ``.to_js_literal()`` method. Implementation seems to
  improve performance by 50 - 90%.
* *SIGNIFICANT* performance gains in the ``.to_json()`` method. Implementation seems to 
  improve performance by 30 - 90%.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Significantly simplified use of the ``.from_pandas()`` method to support:

  * creation of multiple series from one DataFrame in one method call
  * creation of series without needing to specify a full property map
  * support for creating series by DataFrame row, rather than just by DataFrame column

* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added the ``.from_pandas_in_rows()`` method to support creation of
  charts and series from simple two-dimensional DataFrames laid out in rows.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added one-shot chart creation and rendering from Series objects.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added one-shot chart creation using ``series`` and ``data``/``series_type`` keywords.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``.convert_to()`` convenience method to Series objects.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``CallbackFunction.from_python()`` method which converts a Python function
  to its JavaScript equivalent using generative AI, with support for both OpenAI and Anthropic.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed instability issues in Jupyter Notebooks, both when operating as a Notebook (outside of 
  Jupyter Lab) and when saved to a static HTML file.

---------------------

Release 1.3.0
=========================================

* **ENHANCEMENT:** Modified the way that data points are serialized to JavaScript literal objects. Now, they are serialized to a JavaScript array if their configured properties are those that Highcharts (JS) supports in JavaScript array notation. Otherwise, the code falls back to serialize the data point as a JavaScript object literal. This change is intended to improve performance and reduce the size of the serialized data. (#25)
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``__repr__()`` method for Highcharts Core for Python classes.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``__str__()`` method with special handling for difficult-to-read classes.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``Chart.get_script_tags()`` to retrieve Javascript ``<script>`` tags.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``utility_functions.to_snake_case()`` function.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed incorrect serialization of datetime and Pandas ``Timestamp`` objects in ``.to_dict()`` and ``.to_json()``.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed incorrect serialization of ``EnforcedNull`` in ``.to_dict()`` and ``.to_json()``.


---------------------

Release 1.2.0
=========================================

* **ENHANCEMENT:** Align the API to **Highcharts (JS) v.11.1** (#21). In particular, this includes:

  * Changes inherited from **Highcharts Core for Python v.1.2.0**. See `here <https://core-docs.highchartspython.com/en/latest/history.html#release-1-2-0>`__.
  * Added ``TiledWebMapOptions`` / ``TiledWebMapSeries`` support.
  
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added support for the inclusion of scripts based on features used in the chart (#6).
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``dict`` support to ``options.series.labels.SeriesLabel.style`` and ``utility_classes.data_labels.DataLabel.style``.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed de-serialization error in ``options.series.data.geometric.GeometricZData`` which
  prevented the population of ``.properties``.
* **DOCS:** Several documentation fixes.
* **DEPENDENCY:** Bumped ``requests`` version for security patch.

---------------------

Release 1.1.1
=========================================

* **FIXED:** Problem when producing a JS literal, with the JS code inserting an unnecessary ``new``.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added more elegant error handling when something goes wrong displaying a chart in Jupyter.

---------------------
