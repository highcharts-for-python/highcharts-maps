***********************************************************
Highcharts Core for Python vs Highcharts Maps for Python
***********************************************************

**What is the difference between Highcharts Core for Python and Highcharts Maps for Python?**

The `Highcharts Core for Python <https://core-docs.highchartspython.com/>`__ library supports
`Highcharts Core <https://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts/>`__, which is the core
data visualization library developed by `Highsoft <https://www.highcharts.com/>`__. It
provides over 60 different visualization types.

**Highcharts Maps for Python** is an *extension* to **Highcharts Core for Python** in the same
way that `Highcharts Maps <https://www.highcharts.com/products/maps/>`__ is an
*extension* to `Highcharts JS <https://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts/>`__. It:

  * adds new features (including the rendering of map :term:`geometries <map geometry>`)
    to supported charts,
  * adds new series types, including :term:`map`, :term:`map bubble`, :term:`map line`,
    and :term:`map point`

.. tip::

  **Highcharts Maps for Python** *includes* all of the functionality from
  `Highcharts Core for Python <https://core-docs.highchartspython.com/>`__ using the exact same 
  API. As a result, the best practice is that if your application needs any of the features 
  included in **Highcharts Maps for Python**, just use that library.
